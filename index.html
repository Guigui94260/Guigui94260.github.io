            One of my hobbies is playing guitar. Indeed, I play guitar for almost 10 years, and I love this instrument because I can play the melody of the different music that I love listening. In fact, one day, I would like to have the ability to play as good as great musicians. I put a link in the menu on the left of a youtube video where a man plays guitar as good as I would like to do.

            I also love wathcing films where Will Smith acts. I love this actor because I think that he is the embodiment of charism. Depending on the movie, he also makes me laugh as good as he makes me reflect about the world where we live.
            Here are the 3 movies where Will Smith plays that I love the most :

                <li>I, Robot</li>
                <li>Hitch</li>
